# AirgradBanking
Project1 from CS210 Course

//Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was a banking application that would display deposits and interest. 

//What did you do particularly well?
Everything went well with this project and worked as intended. 

//Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I did not spend too much time on input validation. That could be brushed up on to make the program better.

//Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Nothing was too challenging. I used some online references to ensure the interest calculations were correct.

//What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The whole project could be transferable to other projects. 

//How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made inline comments and created functions that could be reused and added upon.
